abstract="In this paper we address the automatic summarization task. Recent research works on extractive-summary generation employ some heuristics, but few works indicate how to select the relevant features. We will present a summarization procedure based on the application of trainable Machine Learning algorithms which employs a set of features extracted directly from the original text. These features are of two kinds: statistical - based on the frequency of some elements in the text; and linguistic - extracted from a simplified argumentative structure of the text. We also present some computational results obtained with the application of our summarizer to some well known text databases, and we compare these results to some baseline summarization procedures.",

    abstract = "Recent coreference resolution models rely heavily on span representations to find coreference links between word spans. As the number of spans is $O(n^2)$ in the length of text and the number of potential links is $O(n^4)$, various pruning techniques are necessary to make this approach computationally feasible. We propose instead to consider coreference links between individual words rather than word spans and then reconstruct the word spans. This reduces the complexity of the coreference model to $O(n^2)$ and allows it to consider all potential mentions without pruning any of them out. We also demonstrate that, with these changes, SpanBERT for coreference resolution will be significantly outperformed by RoBERTa. While being highly efficient, our model performs competitively with recent coreference resolution systems on the OntoNotes benchmark.",

    abstract = "When reading a literary piece, readers often make inferences about various characters{'} roles, personalities, relationships, intents, actions, etc. While humans can readily draw upon their past experiences to build such a character-centric view of the narrative, understanding characters in narratives can be a challenging task for machines. To encourage research in this field of character-centric narrative understanding, we present LiSCU {--} a new dataset of literary pieces and their summaries paired with descriptions of characters that appear in them. We also introduce two new tasks on LiSCU: Character Identification and Character Description Generation. Our experiments with several pre-trained language models adapted for these tasks demonstrate that there is a need for better models of narrative comprehension.",
